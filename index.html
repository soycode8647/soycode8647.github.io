                <h1>A beginner programmer's blog</h1>
                <p><span style="color: #d97706">Hello, World!</span> I will use this website for learning GitHub, web development, writing, and also to document my general programming progress, projects, and ideas.</p>

            <h2>How perfectionism stalled my progress</h2>
            <p>Before becoming a great programmer, you must first become a programmer. And what do programmers do? They press keys in the right sequence and get a desirable outcome.</p>
            <p>Most programmers don't understand half of the code they are writing, although it is a nightmare in the long term, getting things done without overthinking is a fundamental first step to getting started in any topic.</p>
            <p>You've probably heard "Do just enough to move on" somewhere, and it's no meme advice. Perfectionists will overanalyze, they will want to know what every character, every space does. The desire for understanding things deeply will eventually be an advantage, but at the start it is a trap.</p>
            <p>Programming languages are in fact, languages. What is the fastest way to learn a language? Think about how you learned your first language. You didn't start by studying grammar rules, etymology, definitions. You absorbed it, you learned it by association.</p>
            <p>Trying to understand every little detail in the code is what kept me stuck in tutorial hell, I wanted to build cool things, but I never had the "skill", which in my head meant the complete understanding of every instruction down to the hardware. But that's called putting the cart before the horse.</p>
            <p>Instead of watching a 9-hour Python course, or skimming through 5 books, you should be brute-forcing your way through fun projects.</p>
            <p>Once you reach project heaven, once you can get things done, <em>that</em> is the right time to study. It's when you should start caring about clarity, about efficiency, about what it all means under the hood. It's the same way we eventually learned the grammar of our own language â€” <em>after we could already speak it.</em></p>
